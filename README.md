# HTLN-Data-Package
# 
Contains project code for HTLN data package components. The two main areas are metadata (EML) and data validation / certification documents for dataset publishing.
# ToDo
1. Do something in R. Upload a subset of bird data and do a couple of plots just to test out VSCode with R.
