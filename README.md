# HTLN-Data-Package
----------------
Contains project notes and miscellaneous code for creating NPS HTLN data package components. The main areas are metadata (EML) and data validation including exploratory data analyses / data summary / certification documents for dataset publishing. Another objective is to write a set of standard operating procedures (SOP) for creating and publishing HTLN I&M data packages that might also be useful to others with similar datasets. The working example is the HTLN breeding bird protocol and database. Background info on HTLN breeding bird monitoring project is here:

1. Finish Grolemund (2014) Hands-On Programming with R
2. Complete R Tutorial - W3Schools
3. Complete Wickham and Grolemund (2017) R for Data Science
4. Take a deep dive into data visualization with Wickham's ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (Use R!) on-line book

Part II: Learn about processing EML with R and that data sharing is a good thing...
1. CRAN - EML package and associated literature
2. EMLassemblyline (EAL) and EDI 
3. Custom NPS R packages provided through NPSdataverse to facilitate publication of datasets on the NPS Datastore

Part III. Create HTLN breeding bird data package
1. Integrate with Part II, use the bird data to test things while studying up on EML process
2. Document the process as a work flow in a R markdown document
3. Develop QA process for publishing the bird data
4. Test the custom r packages for DataStore using the bird data
