# HTLN-Data-Package
----------------
Contains files and scripts for creating NPS HTLN data package components. The main areas are metadata (EML) and data validation including exploratory data analyses / data summary / certification documents for dataset publishing. The working example is the HTLN breeding bird protocol and database. The directory ./src is my file dumping ground. Files stored in other directories are functioning executable scripts. Thanks for reading!
