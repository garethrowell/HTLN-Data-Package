# HTLN-Data-Package
----------------
Contains project notes and miscellaneous code for creating NPS HTLN data package components. The two main areas are metadata (EML) and data validation / certification documents for dataset publishing. The goal is to write a set of standard operating procedures (SOP) for creating and publishing HTLN I&M data packages that might also be useful to others with similar datasets. The working example is the HTLN breeding bird protocol and database. Background info on HTLN breeding birds here:
